# scadexamples

This is a collection of OpenScad code examples that I find useful, so yes, very personal choices for what is included, based on my needs.

One benefit of OpenScad is the ease of including modules from other sources. That being the case I am using libraries, examples and 3rd party code.  Wherever used, I have first tried to include them as submodule if available in github or otherwise including code with clear references to the sources.

In a similar way I have tried to modularize the code I have written and make it reusable. There also examples where I have found a usable code snipped and made a module of it to reuse it, and again tried to make sure that the original reference is available in comment or Readme file.

## Testing
The script test.sh will go create stl files of all scad files and if any file
fails the script will stop
