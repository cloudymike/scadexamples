# Basket for Standard shelf track

The shelfhook connects to "Standard" dual slotted shelf tracks. These comes in different brands and should be in your local hardware store, but here is an Amazon link as well: https://www.amazon.com/ShelfTrack-2800-Dual-Shelf-Standard/dp/B07LBNVCW9 

The shelfhook is broken out as a module so it can be easily added to your favorite container (shelfhook.scad).

The basket is based on parametric_bin_v1.scad by Micha≈Ç, see https//www.printables.com/model/456226-parametric-storage-bin-box-with-screw-holes-opensc/files  The only change to this file is that I made it a module to be more easily called (basket_module.scad).

The two modules are pulled together into the actual print file in spongebasket.scad
