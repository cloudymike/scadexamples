Crossbar is 1/16 inch thick aluminum and each side is 3/4 inch. Length for each bar is 21 inches so a 4 feet bar is needed. Home depot:

Screws:
* Front #6 5/8
* Back  #6 5/8
* Middle #4 3/4

Peg: shelf peg 5X16mm

The middle screw needs to be a bit smaller as the slide role needs to pass it.

For mounting use 5mm pegs for front and middle holder as they line up with peg holes. For back there is no alignment, just line up with screw hole on rail.
